# CFTR Variant Toolkit

A beginner-friendly, **provenance-honest** walkthrough of the computational tools
used to interpret CFTR variants — the missense pathogenicity predictors, the
splice predictors, the population-frequency reference, and the clinical/functional
truth sets. Built as a teaching companion to the project's A1 (missense triage)
and A2 (splice discordance) analyses.

Each tool gets its own Jupyter notebook explaining **what it is → what the score
means → the threshold and why → how to get the real data**. Two closing notebooks
cover the methodology traps — circular reasoning and training-data leakage (12) —
and run every tool against the whole CFTR2 list to show what none of them can
predict (13, in [`predict/`](predict/README.md)).

## ⚠️ Read this first: REAL vs DEMO — and what a fresh clone ships

Two things matter most about this toolkit. First, which numbers come from *real*
data and which come from small *hand-curated demo tables*. Second — and just as
important — **this repo ships no data at all.** `data/` and `outputs/` are
gitignored, so "REAL" below means *what a loader returns once you have run its
notebook's fetch/build cell*, **not** what you get on `git clone`.

| Source | REAL once you… | Coverage (once built) | Fresh clone gives you | Notebook |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| gnomAD v4.1.1 (allele freq) | run the fetch cell (live query) | ~2,466 missense / ~4,717 non-coding / ~394 other-coding | ❌ `FileNotFoundError` | tools/01 |
| **AlphaMissense** | run the fetch cell (live query) | genome-wide CFTR missense | ❌ `FileNotFoundError` | tools/02 |
| ClinVar | run the fetch cell (live query) | genome-wide | ❌ `FileNotFoundError` | benchmark/00 |
| **CFTR2** (30 Jan 2026) | run the build cell (manual download) | ~2,097 variants / ~780 missense keys | ⚠️ DEMO fallback | benchmark/01 |
| **EVE** | run the build cell (manual download) | ~26,809 CFTR variants | ⚠️ DEMO fallback | tools/03 |
| **ESM1b** | run the build cell (manual download) | ~28,120 CFTR (saturation) | ⚠️ DEMO fallback | tools/04 |
| **REVEL** | run the build cell (manual download) | ~10,127 CFTR (coord-keyed; non-commercial) | ⚠️ DEMO fallback | tools/05 |
| **PrimateAI** | run the build cell (manual download) | ~9,722 CFTR (native Illumina release; research use only) | ⚠️ DEMO fallback | tools/06 |
| **SpliceAI** | run the build cell (manual download) | ~2.08M CFTR records — 566k SNVs **+ 1.51M indels** (Illumina v1.3, CC BY-NC) | ⚠️ DEMO fallback | tools/07 |
| **Pangolin** | run the build cell (runs the model) | ~1,892 CFTR2 variants (SNVs **and** indels) | ⚠️ DEMO fallback | tools/08 |
| CADD | — (live API, no local file) | per-variant | ✅ live (cache it) | tools/09 |

There are **three** states, not two:

- **Live-fetched REAL** (gnomAD, AlphaMissense, ClinVar) — the notebook's fetch cell
  queries a public API/bulk file directly; the loader **raises `FileNotFoundError`**
  until you've run it once. No demo fallback.
- **Manual-download REAL** (CFTR2, EVE, ESM1b, REVEL, PrimateAI, SpliceAI, Pangolin) —
  the notebook's build cell tells you exactly what to download and where to put it
  in `data/`, then parses it; until then the loader **falls back to a small DEMO
  table** (`source='DEMO'`) *with a warning*. Pass `strict=True` to raise instead of
  degrading silently.
- **Live** — CADD is a live API (cache the responses for reproducibility).

**Pangolin is the odd one out:** it has no precomputed release to download, so
its build cell **runs the model locally** (weights ship in the pip package; only the
~215 kb CFTR region is needed, auto-fetched once, ~4 min on a GPU). Its default scope
covers every CFTR2 variant with GRCh38 coordinates → `source='REAL'`; the curated scope
scores just the 5 classic splice alleles and stays `source='DEMO'`. **The label follows
the coverage, not the model.**

**Both splice tools score indels**, which no missense predictor can do. SpliceAI's come
from Illumina's precomputed `raw.indel` release; since `masked.indel` is very often a
0-byte failed download, the built extract is usually **mixed masked/raw** and every row
carries a `score_type` column. Masked and raw agree on 95.8% of CFTR SNVs, but 113 cross
the 0.5 cut — don't compare across the seam (tools/07).

CFTR2 and ClinVar are real *truth sets* (databases), not predictors. Every DataFrame
a loader returns carries a `source` column (`REAL` / `DEMO`) so the two are never
confused. **Never quote a DEMO value as a finding.**

## 🔰 Beginner primer (read before the numbers)

New to CFTR or variant prediction? These four notes unlock the rest of the README.

**Variant vocabulary.** A gene is read in three-letter codons that spell out a
protein. A **missense** variant changes one amino acid; a **synonymous** variant
changes the DNA but *not* the amino acid (yet can still disrupt splicing); a
**splice** variant hits the signals that cut introns out and join exons together; a
**deep intronic** variant sits far inside an intron but can create a *cryptic* splice
site; **non-coding** is the umbrella for everything that isn't a protein-coding
change (intronic, UTR, splice-region, synonymous). The A1 analysis is about
missense; A2 is about splice/non-coding — the variants the missense tools can't see.

**Two ways variants are named, and why joins break.** CFTR variants travel under
several keys, and most "biological disagreements" are really key mismatches:

| Key type | Example | Where it's used | Gotcha |
|---|---|---|---|
| Protein (1-letter) | `G551D` | AlphaMissense, EVE, ESM1b, gnomAD `protein_variant` | only exists for missense |
| Protein (3-letter) | `Gly551Asp` | some curated tables, ClinVar `Name` | must convert to 1-letter to join (`three_to_one()` in `toolkit.py`) |
| HGVS coding | `c.1652G>A` | CFTR2, clinical reports | needs the MANE transcript (`NM_000492.4`) |
| Legacy CFTR name | `2789+5G>A` | CFTR2 history, older literature | no formula — kept as a lookup column |
| Genomic coordinate | `7-117587799-G-A` (`chrom,pos,ref,alt`) | REVEL, SpliceAI, CADD, gnomAD `variant_id` | **CFTR is on the plus strand**, so the genomic `ref/alt` is the *same* as the coding change (coding `c.1624G>T` shows as `G`/`T`) — don't complement; the real risk is joining on the wrong build or the wrong key |

REVEL and SpliceAI are keyed by **coordinate** (no protein position), so they join by
`chrom,pos,ref,alt` — mind the genome build. AlphaMissense/EVE/ESM1b join by
**protein_variant**. `hgvsp_to_short()` and `three_to_one()` in `toolkit.py` are the
helpers that normalise between them.

**Why "the predictor disagrees with ClinVar" isn't always evidence (circularity).**
Testing a predictor against labels it *trained on* is like grading a student with the
exact questions they studied — a high score proves memorisation, not understanding.
REVEL was trained on curated pathogenic/benign labels that share lineage with ClinVar,
so "REVEL vs ClinVar" is partly **circular**. AlphaMissense/EVE/ESM1b never saw
clinical labels, so comparing *them* to ClinVar is closer to independent evidence.
tools/10 quantifies this.

> ### ⚠️ A predictor score is not a clinical diagnosis
> Every threshold in this README (AlphaMissense ≥ 0.564, SpliceAI ≥ 0.5, …) is a
> deliberately simple single cut-point used to build **teaching worklists** — lists
> of variants worth a human's attention. They are **not** ACMG classifications and
> **not** diagnoses. Real clinical use applies *graded* thresholds and multiple lines
> of evidence (Pejaver 2022; tools/05). `score ≥ cutoff` ≠ "pathogenic".

## 📋 The one-page summary (A1 / A2 / B1)

This is the combined one-page summary these notebooks document — reproduced here
so a reader lands on the headline results and their source. Generated 2026-07-01
as part of a CFTR variant-interpretation collaboration.

> ### 🕰️ These are HISTORICAL / demo-reproduced numbers

### Dashboard *(historical / demo — see banner above)*

| Block | Metric | Value |
|---|---|---|
| **A1 · Missense** | CFTR missense variants scored | **2,496** |
| **A1 · Discordant** | Predictor↔database disagreements | **413** |
| **A1 · Priority 1** | VUS, ≥3/5 tools pathogenic | **4** |

### A1 — Missense VUS triage / predictor discordance

Every CFTR missense variant scored by five orthogonal predictors (AlphaMissense,
EVE, ESM1b, REVEL, PrimateAI), then cross-checked against its CFTR2 class and
ClinVar assertion → a **413-variant discordance worklist** where computational
evidence disagrees with the curated classification (403 upgrade + 10 downgrade
candidates; 0 reverse discordance).

*Pathogenic cutoffs:* AlphaMissense ≥ 0.564 · EVE ≥ 0.50 · ESM1b ≤ −7.5 · REVEL ≥ 0.75 · PrimateAI ≥ 0.803.

**Priority 1 — VUS but ≥3/5 tools predict pathogenic** (primary upgrade candidates):

| Variant | HGVS c. | CFTR2 | ClinVar | AM | EVE | ESM1b | REVEL | PAI | Votes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Tyr161Cys** | c.482A>G | VUS | Uncertain | 0.891 | 0.832 | −7.20 | 0.872 | 0.841 | **4/5** |
| **Gly970Asp** | c.2909G>A | VUS | Uncertain | 0.831 | 0.773 | −6.40 | 0.812 | 0.782 | **3/5** |
| **Ser912Leu** | c.2735C>T | VUS | Uncertain | 0.805 | 0.742 | −6.20 | 0.782 | 0.751 | **3/5** |
| **Val520Phe** | c.1558G>T | VUS | Uncertain | 0.778 | 0.718 | −6.00 | 0.755 | 0.731 | **3/5** |

> **Update (real EVE):** with EVE now real, **S912L scores benign (0.085)** and drops
> out, so the honest ≥3/5 count is **3, not 4** (archived integration notebook). The `4` above is the
> original webpage's demo-based figure, kept here as the reproduced summary.

> With the **real CFTR2** loader (benchmark/01) now available, you can compute a fully
> real upgrade set: **256** variants that CFTR2 calls *"No interpretation available"*
> or *"Varying clinical consequence"* while AlphaMissense scores ≥ 0.564.

Source: the archived integration notebook (`archive/`, gitignored) wrote this worklist as
`outputs/A1_upgrade_worklist_REAL.csv` (real AlphaMissense-vs-ClinVar upgrades). **That
file no longer exists** — `outputs/` is gitignored and is now regenerated by
[`predict/`](predict/README.md), which does not yet emit the A1 worklist. Re-run the
archived notebook if you need it, or treat the numbers above as historical.

### A2 — Splice-variant discordance

Deep-intronic, synonymous, and splice-site CFTR variants scored with SpliceAI +
Pangolin delta scores and CADD-Splice PHRED — **invisible to the A1 missense
tools** — then cross-checked against CFTR2/ClinVar. *Thresholds:* SpliceAI/Pangolin
DS_max ≥ 0.5 = HIGH, ≥ 0.2 = MODERATE; CADD-PHRED ≥ 15 = top 3%.

**Splice-risk VUS (primary worklist):**

| Variant | Type | SpliceAI | Pangolin | CADD | Tier |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| c.2657+120C>T † | deep intronic | 0.540 | 0.510 | 17.9 | HIGH |
| IVS8 5T (c.1210-34TG(12)T(5)) | deep intronic | 0.310 | 0.220 | 0.0 | MODERATE |

> **† `c.2657+120C>T` is a synthetic teaching example**, not a confirmed real
> observation, and all scores in this table are `source=DEMO` (hand-authored, not a
> real SpliceAI/Pangolin run). Do not treat this row as a real patient or database
> variant.

**Known CF splice variants (positive controls)** — any real SpliceAI/Pangolin run
should recover HIGH here: 2988+1G>A, 2789+5G>A, 2657+3A>G, 3849+10kb C>T,
3272-26A>G, 1811+1.6kb A>G.

Source: the archived integration notebook (`archive/`, gitignored) wrote this as
`outputs/A2_splice_DEMO.csv`, all rows `source=DEMO`. **That file no longer exists** —
`outputs/` is gitignored and is now regenerated by [`predict/`](predict/README.md).
For the real-data version of this question, tools/07 scores the observed non-coding
variants and predict/13 benchmarks SpliceAI against CFTR2 (~0.97 sensitivity in its
own domain).

### B1 — cftr-varqc reproducible pipeline

An nf-core-style Nextflow workflow packaging the A1 + A2 logic into portable,
containerised, CI-tested infrastructure: takes a CFTR VCF, normalises to HGVS
(MANE NM_000492.4), joins precomputed effect scores, cross-checks CFTR2 + ClinVar,
and emits a MultiQC-style HTML report plus the discordance worklists. Last run:
**6/6 processes succeeded, 0 failed**; 5 local modules; CI stub-run green on every push.

```
INPUT VCF
   ├─ HGVS_NORMALIZE       bcftools norm + SnpEff HGVS (MANE NM_000492.4)
   ├─ SCORE_JOIN_MISSENSE  join AlphaMissense/EVE/ESM1b/REVEL/PrimateAI
   │      └─ CLINVAR_CHECK  → missense discordance worklist   (A1)
   ├─ SPLICE_SCORE         join SpliceAI/Pangolin + CADD-Splice PHRED
   │      └─ CLINVAR_CHECK  → splice discordance worklist      (A2)
   └─ MULTIQC_REPORT       aggregate summaries → HTML + TSV
```

*The `cftr-varqc` pipeline itself is not included in this repository — this
toolkit is the notebook companion. B1 is summarised here for context only.*

## What the headline numbers in the summary report actually mean

> ### ✅ These are the CURRENT real-data rerun numbers
> Computed by tools/10 (missense) and tools/07 (splice) *with the real
> extracts built*. Where they differ from the historical block above, **these are the
> ones to cite.** (Reproduce them yourself only after building the extracts — see
> [`data/README.md`](data/README.md).)

The earlier one-page summary reported the historical `2496 / 413 / 403 / 10 / 4 / 1094`.
Here is what each one actually is, and its corrected real value:

- **2,496 → 2,466.** The real gnomAD v4.1.1 CFTR missense backbone is **2,466** variants;
  the historical **2,496** added ~30 hand-curated famous alleles (G551D, …). Of the
  2,466, **2,430** have an AlphaMissense score and **2,437** have ≥1 real predictor.
- **413 = 403 + 10 → 402 = 392 + 10.** This is a **two-source comparison —
  AlphaMissense vs ClinVar** (AM pathogenic while ClinVar is uncertain = *upgrade*, or
  AM benign while ClinVar is pathogenic = *downgrade*), **not** a five-tool vote. The
  live rerun over real data gives **392 upgrade + 10 downgrade = 402** (archived integration notebook);
  the historical `403/10/413` was the webpage's figure and drifts by a few with the
  ClinVar release used.
- **4 → 473.** "VUS but ≥3/5 tools pathogenic" was a demo-only figure (≥3/5 over ~13
  demo variants; it becomes **3** once real EVE drops S912L). With the real missense
  extracts built, the consensus runs over the **2,466 observed** variants and the real
  A1 Priority-1 worklist is **473** (archived integration notebook). (PrimateAI covers only ~53% of
  sites, so some variants are voted by 4 tools not 5; REVEL/PrimateAI carry
  circularity — tools/10.)
- **1,094 → 4,535 / 173 HIGH.** "1,094 splice variants scored" originally meant **9
  demo variants** (the other ~1,085 unscored). With the real SpliceAI extract built
  (tools/07), **4,535 of the 4,717** observed gnomAD non-coding CFTR variants get a
  real SpliceAI score, of which **173 are HIGH-impact** (≥0.5) and 86 MODERATE — the
  real A2 worklist. (Was 4,260 / 164 before the indel scores were included.)
  (Pangolin now scores it for real too — see
  tools/08; the archived integration notebook's A2 section still used the 9
  curated DEMO rows, so build the real join via tools/07.)

### Count glossary — every number in one place

Every headline number that appears in this README, what it actually counts, and
whether it is current or historical. "Source" points at where it is computed.

| Number | What it counts | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|

| 2,177 | subset of those that are PASS in gnomAD's `joint_filters` (stricter view; live-computed in tools/01, not the same cut as the browser's default) | ✅ current (alt filter) | manifest note |
| 2,430 / 2,437 | of the 2,466: have an AlphaMissense score / have ≥1 real predictor | ✅ current | archived integration nb |

| **4,717** | gnomAD v4.1.1 CFTR **non-coding** variants (intron + synonymous + UTR + splice-region) | ✅ current | tools/01; `gnomad_all.rows` (`gnomad_class=='noncoding'`) |
| **1,094** | historical "splice variants scored" (really 9 DEMO scored + ~1,085 unscored) | 🕰️ historical/demo | webpage |
| **4,535 / 4,717** | non-coding variants that get a **real SpliceAI** score (was 4,260 pre-indels) | ✅ current | tools/07 |
| **173 / 86** | of those 4,535: real SpliceAI HIGH (≥0.5) / MODERATE (0.2–0.5) | ✅ current | tools/07 |
| **2.08M** (2,075,730) | all precomputed SpliceAI CFTR records in the built extract: 566,106 SNVs (masked) + 1,509,624 indels (raw) | ✅ current | tools/07; `spliceai.rows` |
| 9 | hand-curated DEMO splice variants (the A2 teaching table) | 🟡 DEMO | `toolkit.py` |

Coverage counts for the built extracts (saturation unless noted): EVE ~26,809 ·
ESM1b ~28,120 · REVEL 10,826 raw (9,730 canonical-transcript-only, verified saturating —
tools/05) · PrimateAI ~9,722 (native Illumina release, near-saturating — tools/06) ·
CFTR2 ~2,097.

See tools/10 for why "predictor disagrees with ClinVar" is only evidence
when the predictor never trained on ClinVar-lineage labels (REVEL did; the
unsupervised tools did not).

### `benchmark/` — the truth sets tools get graded against

| # | File | Covers | Data on a fresh clone |
|---|---|---|---|
| 00 | `benchmark/00_clinvar.ipynb` | ClinVar — crowd-sourced clinical truth set | REAL if cached, else error |
| 01 | `benchmark/01_cftr2.ipynb` | CFTR2 — disease-specific functional truth set | REAL if built, else DEMO |

### `predict/` — the cross-tool benchmark

| # | File | Covers | Data on a fresh clone |
|---|---|---|---|
| 13 | `predict/13_cftr2_benchmark.ipynb` | **all tools vs the whole CFTR2 list** — coverage in three parts + per-tool performance | needs the built extracts |

One predictor per `tools/` notebook (02–09); `benchmark/00–01` are the truth sets;
`tools/10` is the circularity / temporal-leakage reference; `predict/13` is the
cross-tool benchmark. Recommended order: `tools/01` → `benchmark/00–01` → `tools/10` →
`predict/13`. If you read only one, read **tools/10** (why a predictor "disagreeing
with ClinVar" is only sometimes evidence); if you read two, add **predict/13** (what
none of these tools can do).

> **`predict/` — the cross-tool pipeline.** [`predict/`](predict/README.md) runs every
> tool against the full CFTR2 list and writes its results to `outputs/`. Only **205** of
> the 2,097 variants get no score at all — but **951 (45%)** have no tool that addresses

⚠ REVEL is the one to distrust when benchmarking against ClinVar (it may have
trained on the same labels). Note ESM1b runs the *opposite* direction — more
negative = more damaging. All thresholds are single-cut simplifications; the ACMG
calibration (Pejaver 2022, PMID 36413997) uses *graded* thresholds — see
tools/05, predict/13.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# then, from this folder:
jupyter lab           # or: jupyter notebook
```

Open `tools/00_overview_and_setup.ipynb` first.

### The REAL loaders need data you fetch/build yourself

**Nothing under `data/` or `outputs/` ships in the repo** — see
**[`data/README.md`](data/README.md)** for how to fetch and build every extract.
Concretely:

- **Live-fetched** (gnomAD, AlphaMissense, ClinVar) — the fetch cell near the top of
  `tools/01_gnomad.ipynb`, `tools/02_alphamissense.ipynb`, and
  `benchmark/00_clinvar.ipynb` queries a public API/bulk file directly and writes
  `data/<tool>.tsv`. Missing → `FileNotFoundError` until you run it.
- **Manual-download** (CFTR2, EVE, ESM1b, REVEL, PrimateAI, SpliceAI, Pangolin) — the
  build cell in that tool's own notebook tells you exactly what to download and
  where, then reads `data/<tool>.csv`. Missing → **DEMO fallback** (warning), or
  `strict=True` to raise.
- **No data needed** — the DEMO tables and the live CADD API (`tools/09_cadd.ipynb`)
  work on a bare clone.

### Run all notebooks headless

```bash
for dir in tools benchmark; do
  cd "$dir"
  for nb in *.ipynb; do jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --inplace "$nb"; done
  cd ..
done
```

## Known limitations (by design / honesty)

- **On a fresh clone, every predictor is DEMO or errors** — because no data ships
  (see the REAL/DEMO table). The seven manual-download loaders (CFTR2, EVE, ESM1b, REVEL,
  PrimateAI, SpliceAI, Pangolin) become REAL once you run their notebook's build cell;
  gnomAD, AlphaMissense, and ClinVar need their notebook's fetch cell. Pangolin has no
  precomputed release, so its build cell runs the real model locally over the whole
  CFTR2 list (a curated-scope option keeps the 5-allele teaching run at DEMO). Build
  the extracts before treating any output as a finding, and check the `source` column.
- The 9 curated splice variants have hand-entered genomic coordinates; **several do
  not match the GRCh38 reference** (tools/07 shows why they don't reproduce against
  real SpliceAI). One VUS (`c.2657+120C>T`) is an explicitly *synthetic* teaching example.
- **Reproducibility caveats:** ClinVar updates ~weekly and the *default* fetch
  (`CLINVAR_RELEASE = "latest"`) tracks that rolling file — every fetch records
  its resolved version into `clinvar_release`, and `benchmark/00_clinvar.ipynb`
  can pin a specific `YYYY-MM` from NCBI's monthly archive instead if you need
  an exact historical release. CADD is a **live API** (cache responses, or a
  rerun can change/fail on network behaviour rather than biology). Both are
  noted in `data_manifest.json`.
- The A1 discordance list did **not** apply a training-cutoff temporal hold-out;
  **tools/10** (the circularity / temporal-leakage reference) explains how, and flags
  which tool×variant pairs risk leakage (e.g. F508del, reported 1989, vs any
  label-supervised tool trained after). Note CFTR2 is **not** an independent truth set —
  it shares clinical evidence with ClinVar and they cross-cite, so it is only *partially*
  orthogonal (its functional-assay axis), not circularity-free.

## Related work — we *reproduce*, not discover

Aggregating predictors + cross-checking ClinVar/CFTR2 is well established
(**OpenCRAVAT / OakVar**, **dbNSFP**, Ensembl VEP + plugins). The A1/A2 analyses
here **reproduce** published CFTR results rather than discovering them:
McDonald et al. 2023 (*PLOS ONE*, AlphaMissense's high false-positive rate vs
CFTR2), Tordai et al. 2024 (*Sci Data*), Bergougnoux et al. 2022 (*J Cyst Fibros*,
splice VUS), and the ACMG CFTR standard (Deignan et al. 2021, *Genet Med*). The
toolkit's contribution is the **honest REAL/DEMO provenance + CFTR teaching**.
