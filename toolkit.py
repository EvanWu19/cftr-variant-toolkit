"""
cftr_variant_toolkit / toolkit.py
=================================
The small set of constants and helpers genuinely SHARED across notebooks:
published thresholds, the tool/circularity registry, score->call logic, the
curated DEMO panel, and amino-acid key helpers — plus a thin load_<tool>()
reader per dataset (read data/<file>, tag source, DEMO fallback).

This file deliberately does NOT contain fetch/build logic anymore. Each
dataset's fetch-or-build code (how data/<file> gets created in the first
place — a live API call, a filtered download, or a locally-run model) lives
in the ONE notebook that owns that tool (tools/01-06, benchmark/00-01), right
next to the loader call and the license/provenance note for that source. That
used to be split across this file's docstrings, seven build_*.py scripts, and
two fetch_*.py scripts that were referenced everywhere but never committed —
opaque provenance masquerading as documentation. Read a tool's own notebook
to see exactly how its data was obtained; there is nowhere else to look.

Design goals
------------
1.  **Honest about provenance.** Every DataFrame this module returns carries a
    ``source`` column whose value is either ``"REAL"`` (downloaded from the
    primary source / queried live) or ``"DEMO"`` (a small, hand-curated table of
    illustrative values baked into this file). Never mix them silently.

2.  **One data/ folder, no hidden cache.** Every dataset — whether pulled live
    from an API, filtered from a bulk download, or produced by running a model
    locally — lands in ``data/`` once its owning notebook's fetch cell has run.
    There is no separate ``_tmp_fetch/`` cache; a loader either finds its file
    in ``data/`` or falls back to DEMO (or raises, for the three live-queried
    sources that have no DEMO fallback).

3.  **Beginner-readable.** Each function documents *what the tool is*, *what the
    score means*, *the threshold and why*, and *the primary reference*.

Real vs demo — and what a fresh clone actually ships
----------------------------------------------------
    IMPORTANT: this repo ships CODE + NOTEBOOKS + manifest ONLY. ``data/`` and
    ``outputs/`` are gitignored, so a fresh clone contains NONE of the datasets
    below. "REAL" describes what a loader returns *once its owning notebook's
    fetch cell has been run* — not what is in the box.

    On a fresh clone, each loader behaves as:
      REAL only after you run the fetch cell in its notebook (else FileNotFoundError):
        gnomAD v4 missense + non-coding (tools/01), AlphaMissense (tools/02),
        ClinVar (benchmark/00) — each queries/downloads live, no DEMO fallback
      REAL only after you run the build cell in its notebook, else DEMO fallback:
        CFTR2 (~2,097, benchmark/01), EVE (~26,809, tools/03),
        ESM1b (~28,120 saturation, tools/04), REVEL (~10,127 unique coordinates,
        non-commercial, tools/05), PrimateAI (~1,976, dbNSFP ClinVar subset,
        non-commercial, tools/06), SpliceAI (~566k SNVs; CC BY-NC 4.0)
      REAL, queried live per-call (no local data needed):
        CADD v1.7 REST API
      DEMO always (hand-curated illustrative values — NOT real predictions):
        Pangolin (9 curated splice variants only; a local model run also gives a REAL
        model-run path over the full CFTR2 list)

    => The six build-locally loaders fall back to a tiny DEMO table when their
       extract is missing. Pass ``strict=True`` to raise instead of silently
       degrading; the default emits a warning. See ``data/README.md`` for the
       provenance summary and ``data_manifest.json`` for exact hashes/licenses.

def load_gnomad_all() -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Every CFTR variant gnomAD v4.1.1 reports, classified (REAL).

    gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database) is a reference set of human variation
    from a joint call of ~730k exomes + ~76k genomes. Allele frequency (AF) is
    a classification method in its own right, independent of any protein
    structure/sequence model: a truly CF-causing recessive allele should be
    rare (AF typically < 1e-3), so a "pathogenic" prediction on a common
    variant is a red flag (ACMG BS1/BA1).

    Returns one row per CFTR variant (~7,577), with `gnomad_class` one of:
    "missense" (scorable by AlphaMissense/EVE/REVEL/ESM1b/PrimateAI),
    "noncoding" (intron/synonymous/UTR/splice-region — outside what a
    missense predictor models at all), or "other_coding" (stop_gained,
    frameshift, inframe indel, start/stop lost/retained — protein-coding but
    not a single-residue substitution, so missense predictors don't apply;
    typically evaluated via ACMG PVS1 instead).

    `gnomad_af` is gnomAD v4.1's *joint* allele frequency (`joint.ac /
    joint.an`), which sums allele counts across the exome and genome cohorts
    before dividing — a real combined-cohort estimate, not the larger of two
    independently-normalized proportions.

    Thin reader only: the gnomAD GraphQL fetch that builds

    (acceptor gain), DS_AL (acceptor loss), DS_DG (donor gain), DS_DL
    (donor loss), each 0–1. DS_max = max of the four. DS_max >= 0.5 = high

    one 0–1 score.

    REAL if the extract exists: the precomputed Illumina **SpliceAI v1.3** scores for
    the whole CFTR region (`data/spliceai_cftr_2021_v1.3.csv`, ~2.08 M records), built
    by a manual-download build cell (a hand-rolled .tbi seek, since pysam doesn't build
    on Windows) -- see data/README.md; the SpliceAI notebook itself is pending audit and
    not published yet. Keyed by genomic coordinate (chrom,pos,ref,alt); columns
    DS_AG/DS_AL/DS_DG/DS_DL and spliceai_ds_max (>= 0.5 high, >= 0.2 moderate). Join
    onto observed variants (e.g. gnomAD non-coding) by coordinate to build the real A2
    splice worklist.

    **SNVs *and* indels** (~566 k + ~1.51 M). The indels matter: no missense predictor
    can score one, so without them every CFTR2 deletion/insertion was invisible to every
    tool — including F508del, which SpliceAI scores DS_max = 0.01 (correct: it is a
    folding defect, not a splice one).

    ⚠ The extract is usually **MIXED masked/raw**: Illumina's `masked.indel` release is
    very often a 0-byte failed download, so the builder falls back to `raw.indel` while
    SNVs come from `masked.snv`. Each row carries `score_type` ('masked'/'raw') and
    `variant_class` ('snv'/'indel'). Raw does not zero out biologically implausible
    directions, so raw >= masked for the same variant: across the CFTR SNVs the two
    agree exactly 95.8% of the time (mean |diff| 0.0019), but 113 cross the 0.5 cut.
    Don't compare a masked score against a raw one and call the difference biology.

    The extract is gitignored (CC BY-NC 4.0) → fresh clone falls back to the 9
    curated variants (load_splice_demo) with a warning; strict=True raises,
    demo=True is silent. Note those hand-entered coordinates mostly do NOT
    reproduce against real precomputed SpliceAI (coordinate errors + limited
    deep-intronic coverage in the precomputed release).

    Pangolin (Zeng & Li 2022, Genome Biol 23:103, PMID 35449021,
    github.com/tkzeng/Pangolin) has no precomputed per-gene release and is not in
    dbNSFP, so real scores require RUNNING the model locally (weights bundled with the
    pip package; only the ~215 kb CFTR reference region is needed, no whole-genome
    download) -- see data/README.md; the Pangolin notebook is pending audit and not
    published yet. Score 0-1, >= 0.5 high, >= 0.2 moderate; keyed by genomic coordinate.

    REAL if the extract exists (``data/pangolin_cftr.csv``). The build cell's
    default ``SCOPE = "cftr2"`` scores every CFTR2 variant carrying GRCh38
    coordinates — ~1,892 of 2,097, **SNVs and indels** — and labels the result
    ``source='REAL'``; ``SCOPE = "curated"`` scores just the 5 classic splice alleles
    and stays ``source='DEMO'``, because that coverage is a teaching subset rather
    than a worklist. The label follows the *scope*, never the model. Rows that could
    not be scored are kept with an empty score and a ``skip_reason``.

    Because Pangolin is run locally it reaches variant classes the precomputed
    masked-SNV SpliceAI release cannot (notably indels) — but note: a
    Pangolin score on a frameshift is a *splice* verdict, and "no splice impact" is
    usually correct and rarely the reason the variant is pathogenic.
