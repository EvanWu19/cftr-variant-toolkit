# Data licensing & sharing — concerns before publishing data or results

**Status: partly resolved (July–August 2026). See the update box below.**
**I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.** This is an engineering-level
review of the data-use terms recorded in [`data_manifest.json`](data_manifest.json),
written so the open questions are visible instead of implicit. Every item marked
⚠️ should be confirmed against the provider's own current terms before anything is
published — the terms below are what the manifest records, not what I verified with
each licensor.

## ✅ Update — 2026-08-07: EVE resolved too — four blanks now closed, all in your favour

Four of the datasets this document treated as restricted or unconfirmed have now
been re-checked against the providers' current public terms. **All four moved
toward *more* permissive**, which materially widens what you can publish. See
[`PUBLISHING.md`](PUBLISHING.md) for the resulting publish/hold decision per file.

| Dataset | This doc originally said | Verified current term | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AlphaMissense** | CC BY-NC-SA (unconfirmed) | **CC BY 4.0** — DeepMind lifted the NonCommercial restriction on **13 Mar 2024** (verified 2026-07-31) | ✅ **Publishable** with attribution. Also **dissolves License Conflict #3** — there is no ShareAlike term left to clash with PrimateAI's ND. |
| **gnomAD** | *(no license recorded)* | **ODbL** (Open Database License) + MIT terms (verified 2026-07-31) | ✅ **Redistributable** with attribution, keep-open, and ShareAlike-under-ODbL. gnomAD explicitly states there are "no restrictions or embargoes" on publishing derived results. |
| **ClinVar** | *(no license recorded)* | **CC0 1.0 / U.S. public domain**; NCBI places "no restrictions on use or distribution" (verified 2026-07-31) | ✅ **Redistributable**; attribution merely *requested*. CFTR2's expert-panel calls reach ClinVar under the same CC0. |
| **EVE** | Unconfirmed — site said to be JS-only, no machine-readable license | **MIT** — evemodel.org's Bulk Protein Data and Single Protein Data pages both state verbatim: *"The downloading of this data, and of all other data on this site, falls under the MIT License."* (verified 2026-08-07, via a JS-rendering browser — the earlier "JS-only, no license visible" note was a limitation of the tool used to check it, not the site) | ✅ **Publishable** — no attribution notice beyond the standard MIT copyright/license text, no NC, no ShareAlike. Matches the GitHub code license (MIT, copyright Pascal Notin 2021). |

**Still restricted (unchanged, correctly recorded):** SpliceAI (CC BY-NC 4.0),
REVEL (non-commercial; redistribution unaddressed). **PrimateAI switched sources
2026-08-08** (from a dbNSFP subset to its own native Illumina release) — the
restriction changed shape but not effect: it's now **"for research use only"**
(Illumina, 2018, stated verbatim in the release file's own header) instead of
dbNSFP's CC BY-NC-ND. Still the one hard blocker for redistribution.

> One caveat on the gnomAD/ClinVar wins: gnomAD ships **SpliceAI annotations under
> CC BY-NC**, so if you ever republish a gnomAD *slice that includes its SpliceAI
> columns*, that column inherits the NC restriction even though the allele
> frequencies do not. Publish gnomAD frequency columns, not gnomAD's SpliceAI column.

---

## The short version

**The code, the notebooks, and the build scripts are yours to publish freely.**
The concern is only about **the data extracts** (`data/*.csv`) and **the derived
result tables** (`outputs/*.csv`) — because they contain, or are computed from,
third-party scores whose licenses restrict redistribution.

Right now the repo is **safe by construction**: `.gitignore` excludes `data/`
(except `data/README.md`), `outputs/`, `_tmp_fetch/`, and `archive/`, so none of it
has ever been pushed. **The concerns below are about changing that.**

**The single riskiest file** is
`outputs/predict_cftr2_benchmark_ALL.csv` — 2,097 variants × per-variant scores from
**seven** different tools (AlphaMissense, EVE, ESM1b, REVEL, PrimateAI, SpliceAI,
Pangolin) merged into one table. It is simultaneously subject to *every* restriction
listed below, and at least two of those restrictions appear to be mutually
incompatible (see [License conflict](#3-two-licenses-that-may-not-be-combinable)).

---

## Why this is not one question but three

Not all "data" carries the same risk. It helps to separate three layers:

| Layer | Example | Risk | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Raw third-party downloads** | `spliceai_scores.masked.snv.hg38.vcf.gz` (28.6 GB), `revel-v1.3_all_chromosomes.zip`, dbNSFP parquet | **Highest — do not publish** | Straight redistribution of the licensor's product. Never in the repo; keep it that way. |
| **2. Derived per-CFTR extracts** | `data/spliceai_cftr_2021_v1.3.csv` (~2.08 M rows, ~116 MB), `data/revel_cftr_v1.3.csv`, `data/primateai_cftr.csv` | **High — currently my main concern** | These are *filtered subsets*, not transformations. A CFTR-region slice of SpliceAI is still SpliceAI's scores; the substance is the licensor's. |
| **3. Derived aggregate results** | `outputs/predict_tool_performance.csv` (17 lines: n / TP / FP / sensitivity), `outputs/predict_category_summary.csv` (counts) | **Lowest — likely publishable** | Summary statistics *about* the data, not the data. Widely treated as ordinary research reporting. |

**The per-variant benchmark table sits in layer 2, not layer 3**, even though it
lives in `outputs/`. A table with one row per variant and a column per tool
reconstitutes a usable copy of each tool's scores for CFTR — that is redistribution,
regardless of the folder it is in.

## Per-dataset concerns

License text is as recorded in `data_manifest.json`. **"Confidence" is my confidence
in the *restriction*, not permission** — low confidence means *check before relying
on it*, never *assume it's fine*.

| Dataset | Recorded terms | My concern | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PrimateAI** (native Illumina release, switched from dbNSFP 2026-08-08) | **"For research use only"** — stated verbatim in the release file's own header (Illumina, 2018) | ⚠️ **Still the sharpest problem, different mechanism.** Not an ND/derivatives question anymore — it's a direct use-scope restriction. "Research use only" is generally read as excluding redistribution on a public repo (a commercial platform, reachable by anyone) regardless of derivative status. Our `primateai_cftr.csv` is filtered/re-keyed either way. | High that redistribution is out of scope for "research use only" |
| **SpliceAI** (Illumina precomputed v1.3) | **CC BY-NC 4.0** — attribute SpliceAI + Illumina | ⚠️ **NonCommercial** is genuinely ambiguous for a public GitHub repo. Publishing to a free public repo is not obviously "commercial," but GitHub is a commercial platform and downstream users may be commercial. CC BY-NC also **requires** the license notice + attribution to travel with the data. Our extract is ~2.08 million rows / ~116 MB — substantial, not a token sample. | High that NC + attribution apply; unsure whether public-repo hosting violates NC |
| **REVEL** | "free for **non-commercial** use (contact authors otherwise)" | ⚠️ This is **not a standard license** — it is a usage permission with no stated *redistribution* right. Permission to *use* data is not permission to *republish* it. The instruction to "contact the authors" suggests case-by-case licensing. | High that redistribution is unaddressed |
| **EVE** | ~~"EVE / evemodel.org terms — CONFIRM before publishing this extract"~~ → **MIT** (verified 2026-08-07) | ✅ **Resolved — publishable.** evemodel.org states both data and code fall under MIT (matches the GitHub repo's own MIT LICENSE, copyright Pascal Notin 2021). No NC, no ShareAlike, no attribution requirement beyond standard MIT notice. | High — verified directly on evemodel.org's download pages |
| **AlphaMissense** | ~~CC BY-NC-SA (unconfirmed)~~ → **CC BY 4.0** (relicensed 13 Mar 2024) | ✅ **Resolved — publishable.** Attribution only; no NonCommercial, no ShareAlike. Removes the Conflict #3 blocker. Cite Cheng et al. 2023 + note the CC BY 4.0 release. | High — verified against DeepMind's release |
| **CFTR2** | "CFTR2 public data-use terms (cite CFTR2)" | Mildest of the restricted set — CFTR2 publishes this variant list openly and asks for citation. Still has *its own terms*; "public" is not the same as "unrestricted." Worth reading the actual data-use statement rather than assuming. | Medium-low concern, but read the terms |
| **gnomAD** | ~~*(no license recorded)*~~ → **ODbL** + MIT | ✅ **Resolved — redistributable.** Attribute gnomAD, keep derived DB open, share adaptations under ODbL. Do not reidentify participants. Publish frequency columns, **not** gnomAD's bundled CC BY-NC SpliceAI column. | High — verified against gnomAD policies page |
| **ClinVar** | ~~*(no license recorded)*~~ → **CC0 1.0 / public domain** | ✅ **Resolved — redistributable.** NCBI places no use/distribution restrictions; attribution requested. Don't imply endorsement. | High — verified against NCBI policy |
| **CADD** | *(no license recorded)*; live API | We store no bulk CADD data — scores are fetched live per variant. If you ever cache CADD responses into a published file, this needs checking (CADD has separate academic/commercial terms). | Low now; would rise if cached |
| **Pangolin** | non-commercial; cite Zeng & Li 2022 | `pangolin_cftr.csv` is **model output we computed ourselves**, which is a better position than redistributing someone's published table — but the model's license is still non-commercial, and output-ownership terms are worth confirming. | Medium — better footing, still NC |

## The three specific problems that worry me most

### 1. "Non-commercial" is undefined for a public GitHub repo

Five of these datasets are NC-restricted. Nobody is paying you, so intuitively this
feels non-commercial — but a public repo is a *distribution channel* to anyone,
including commercial users, hosted on a commercial platform. Different licensors read
this differently, and CC's own NC definition turns on whether use is "primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage," which is about *your* purpose
but says little about downstream recipients. **I cannot tell you where this lands,
and I don't think you should guess.**

### 2. A "filtered subset" may still be redistribution

It is tempting to think that slicing SpliceAI down to CFTR (~2 M of billions of rows)
makes it a new thing. I don't think that reasoning is safe: the *value* in the file is
entirely the licensor's predictions, and the selection is mechanical (a coordinate
range). The strongest version of this concern is PrimateAI's **"research use only"**
term, which targets exactly this regardless of how the data is sliced.

### 3. Two licenses that may not be combinable

**➡️ 2026-07-31: this conflict is largely dissolved.** AlphaMissense is now
**CC BY 4.0** (no ShareAlike), so the direct SA-vs-ND contradiction is gone. What
remains is simpler but still real: `predict_cftr2_benchmark_ALL.csv` still merges
**PrimateAI ("research use only")**, **REVEL (NC)**, and **SpliceAI (CC BY-NC)** into
one table. Research-use-only means you may not distribute the PrimateAI column
outside research use *at all*, so the merged table remains **hold / do-not-publish**
as-is.

Original framing, for the record:

- ~~**AlphaMissense: CC BY-NC-SA** → derivatives must be shared alike~~ (no longer applies)
- ~~**dbNSFP/PrimateAI: CC BY-NC-ND** → adapted material *must not* be distributed.~~
  (PrimateAI switched to its native release 2026-08-08 — now "research use only"
  directly from Illumina, not an ND-derivatives question via dbNSFP. Same practical
  outcome: still a hard blocker.)

**Fix, unchanged:** split results per-source, drop the ND/NC columns, or publish only
aggregates. A benchmark table carrying **only your own derived calls** (`category`,
`mechanism`, `n_missense_tools`) plus the variant key is fully publishable and lets
anyone rebuild the scores with `build_*.py`.

---

## ~~Also: the repo itself has no LICENSE file~~ → ✅ Added 2026-07-31

A root [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) (MIT) now covers the code, notebooks, and docs, with an
explicit **scope notice** that it does **not** re-license any third-party data. A
[`CITATION.cff`](CITATION.cff) makes the toolkit citable. The original reasoning
below still explains *why* this matters:

- **For your code:** with no license, default copyright applies — others technically
  have no right to use, modify, or redistribute your notebooks, even though the repo
  is public. If you want this to be a teaching resource people can actually use, it
  needs an explicit license (MIT/Apache-2.0/CC-BY are common for this kind of work).
- **For the data question:** a repo-level license cannot grant rights you don't hold.
  If restricted data were ever committed, an MIT LICENSE at the root would be making
  a promise about third-party data you're not in a position to make.

---

## What I'd suggest (in order)

1. **Keep the current posture as the default.** Code + notebooks + build scripts +
   manifest + `data/README.md` ship; data and per-variant outputs stay gitignored.
   This is already implemented and it is the reason there's no problem today.
2. **Publish aggregates freely.** Tool performance stats, category counts, coverage
   figures, and the notebook *narrative* carry the scientific message without
   redistributing anyone's scores. `predict_tool_performance.csv` and
   `predict_category_summary.csv` are in this category.
3. **Add a LICENSE for your own work**, with an explicit note that it covers the code
   and documentation **only**, not any third-party data the scripts download.
4. ~~**Resolve EVE and AlphaMissense**, which the manifest itself flags as
   unconfirmed.~~ **Done** — both closed (AlphaMissense 2026-07-31, EVE
   2026-08-07); both are MIT/CC BY, publishable.
5. **If you want to publish per-variant tables, ask the licensors.** A short email to
   the REVEL authors, dbNSFP, and Illumina/SpliceAI describing exactly what you want
   to publish (a CFTR-only extract, for teaching, on a public repo) would replace all
   of the guessing above with a real answer. Several groups grant this readily.
6. **If you need per-variant results published before that resolves**, consider
   publishing **only the variant identifiers plus your own derived calls/categories**
   (e.g. `category`, `mechanism`, `n_missense_tools`) and *omitting the third-party
   score columns*. That preserves reproducibility — anyone can rebuild the scores with
   the `build_*.py` scripts — without you redistributing the scores.

## Questions worth putting to each provider

If you do write to them, these are the specific things left unanswered here:

- May I publish a **gene-restricted subset** of your scores in a **public,
  non-commercial, educational** repository?
- Does a **column-renamed / re-keyed / de-duplicated** extract count as a
  **derivative** under your terms? *(critical for dbNSFP's ND)*
- Is hosting on **GitHub** (a commercial platform, free tier) compatible with your
  **non-commercial** clause?
- May I publish a **merged multi-tool table**, or must each tool's scores be
  distributed separately under its own terms?

my own, so it can be resolved deliberately rather than by omission.*
